🚀 AI-Powered Interview Platform

A next-generation, real-time AI Interview Simulation System designed to replicate real-world technical and HR interviews using modern web technologies and intelligent interaction models.

This platform provides a structured and immersive mock interview environment by combining live media streaming, voice recognition, and dynamic response capture — forming the foundation for future AI-driven evaluation and analytics.

🌍 Overview

Traditional mock interview platforms lack realism, interaction depth, and intelligent feedback mechanisms. This system bridges that gap by integrating:

🎥 Live camera simulation

🎤 Real-time speech-to-text processing

⌨️ Structured typed response handling (DSA / theory rounds)

📝 Dynamic interviewer-controlled question input

🔄 Seamless real-time UI interaction

The long-term objective is to evolve this into a fully autonomous AI Interview Engine capable of evaluating communication skills, technical accuracy, and problem-solving ability.
